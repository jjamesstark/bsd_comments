Students who read for pleasure are more likely to achieve greater academic success in school than students who don't. Research shows that if there is a librarian working with classroom teachers, student achievement is higher. Librarians are uniquely positioned to inspire students to read.\nAs a retired teacher-librarian of 24 years, I know this job is SO much more than checking out and shelving books. Librarians are the backbone of a school's success in creating life-long learners. They know the books within their collection that can turn kids onto reading. They are not\"assistants\". They are \"librarians\". I hope the Beaverton School District will reclassify this position and provide the deserved and already earned financial support for this vital position.\nRespectfully,\nCindy Glenn\n"}, {"id": "2024-03-19_Oleg_Sidorov", "date": "2024-03-19", "first_name": "Oleg", "last_name": "Sidorov", "association_with_bsd": "Parent/Guardian", "sentiment": "Negative", "topics": ["school schedules", "Sato Elementary", "early start", "student petition"], "comment": "Hello,\nMany Sato elementary school families are concerned about the BSD decision to make Sato an early start school.\nMy daughter [name] and her friend [name] started an initiative to revert the school schedule back to the late start.\nI have helped them by starting a petition on change.org that currently gathered more that 200 supporters within Sato community.

This is why reading scores are higher in schools with library programs. It's not just reading to kids, even though that is extremely important. It is knowing the literature, how to present it, how to make it accessible, how to embed it into students' lives so they see the relevance and importance and personal satisfaction of learning.

There is considerable community opposition to the current plan to construct a mega elementary school in that location, in part because the plan to close small community elementaries and bus students to fill a mega elementary at Raleigh Hills was not disclosed to voters prior to voter approval of the 2022 bond measure.\nI voted yes on the 2022 bond measure. If the district had disclosed that the bond money would be used to construct mega elementaries and close existing small elementaries, I would have voted no on the bond measure.

I reviewed Renaissance Learning's privacy policies, and even reached out to them for clarification. From what I understand, Renaissance is allowed to use our student's data for further research, product enhancements, etc. That sounds benign, but Renaissance staff from other countries (i.e. China) can use the data. Anonymizing the data may protect an individual's identity, but this is still a huge concern. We should either stop using Renaissance or ensure BSD student data is protected from going overseas.\nMy second concern is about the need for parent/guardian notification before conducting the social emotional behavior screener and providing an opt out.

Teachers see ALL students as their own & work to support students who are no longer in their grade level. This results in better stuednt behavior compared to large schools.It also allows the staff to know the families, providing a welcome space to poor, diverse & marginalized families. In schools like McKay, many parents do not drive but will walk to school events. Moving these families further away will decrease parent participation.

As a teacher at McKay the value of a small school can not even be explained. As a teacher I know every student in the school, their families and their stories. Teaching at a large mega school does not appeal to me at all as I love the community and connections within a small school. Also, from a safety standpoint I noticed in the pictures of the new build the district has posted it looked like windows were on classrooms out to the hallway. This would not be a safe design in terms of being out of sight from danger. Hallways are also were students who are not regulated tend to end up and this would cause distraction and chaos.

As parents, we both volunteered at the school and felt deeply connected to the school community.\nI understand that the student body at Montclair has been shrinking and that is a problem. However, based on my discussions with other parents whose kids attend mega-schools, the mega-school model is not healthy for kids. It is hard to have a cohesive sense of community in a large school. The communal areas are often loud and overwhelming from a sensory standpoint, including the areas where kids go to have special instruction.\nI understand that a change may need to be made. However, instead of building one new mega-school, I strongly encourage you to make changes to increase the student body in several small successful small schools that we already have in our community.\n"}, {"id": "2024-08-13_Amy_Starke", "date": "2024-08-13", "first_name": "Amy", "last_name": "Starke", "association_with_bsd": "Other Community Member", "sentiment": "Negative", "topics": ["Montclair Elementary", "community schools", "small schools", "student experience"], "comment": "My husband and I have lived in Beaverton for 32 years, and our two now-grown sons attended Beaverton schools (Montclair, Whitford, Beaverton HS and School of Science and Technology).

Ishana's initiative, Youth-preneurs, has empowered over 200 students of color in the Beaverton area, providing them with opportunities to develop their business skills and confidence through engaging workshops and pitch competitions. Her program has been instrumental in fostering a spirit of innovation among young students, preparing them to become future leaders in our community.\nRecently, Ishana's work with her organization Youth-preneurs was featured in the Portland Tribune, a testament to the positive impact she has had not only within our district but also in the wider Portland community. Her vision for accessible education and youth empowerment has been widely acknowledged and celebrated.\nI encourage the board to formally recognize Ishana Senthil's dedication\n"}, {"id": "2024-10-08_Laurie_Umiger", "date": "2024-10-08", "first_name": "Laurie", "last_name": "Umiger", "association_with_bsd": "Parent/Guardian", "sentiment": "Negative", "topics": ["district communication", "teacher contract", "transparency", "community relations"], "comment": "As a parent and community member, the notice sent to the community reads more like propaganda making an effort to vilify certified staff then any sort of transparent communication with the community.
